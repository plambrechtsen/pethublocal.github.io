This is project aims to completely reverse engineer the cloud service for the Sure Petcare "Connect" series of internet enabled pet devices and to provide a local network backend for the Connect Hub to connect to rather than using their cloud service.

It was born out of frustration with the cloud service being unstable over Christmas 2020/January 2021 and from a privacy perspective I prefer to not to have all my animals movements being sent off to their cloud service.

End goal is to connect it to Home Assistant and equally if folks wanted to they could connect it into OpenHAB as I have kept it generic and am just sending MQTT messages to topics with the configuration and status.

It has been through various refactors and rebuilds to where it is now. Patches are always welcome.
